# Design Patterns

Design patterns are solutions to software design problems you find again and again in real-world application development. Patterns are about reusable designs and interactions of objects.

The 23 Gang of Four (GoF) patterns are generally considered the foundation for all other patterns. They are categorized in three groups: Creational, Structural, and Behavioral (for a complete list see below). This reference provides source code for each of the 23 GoF patterns.

# What are Design Patterns in software development?
 
Design Patterns in the object-oriented world is a reusable solution to common software design problems that occur repeatedly in real-world application development. It is a template or description of how to solve problems that can be used in many situations.
<br/>
#### *"A pattern is a recurring solution to a problem in a context."*
 
#### *"Each pattern describes a problem that occurs over and over again in our environment, and then describes the core of the solution to that problem, in such a way that you can use this solution a million times over, without ever doing it the same way twice." - Christopher Alexander, A Pattern Language.*
<br/>
Patterns are used by developers for their specific designs to solve their problems. Pattern choice and usage among various design patterns depends on individual needs and problems. Design patterns are a very powerful tool for software developers. It is important to understand design patterns rather than memorizing their classes, methods, and properties. It is also important to learn how to apply patterns to specific problems to get the desired result. This will be the required continuous practice for using and applying design patterns in day to day software development. First, identify the software design problem then see how to address these problems using design patterns and determine the best-suited design problem to solve the problem.

### Creational Design Pattern
* [Singleton Pattern](https://github.com/adichamoli/DesignPatterns/tree/main/Creational%20Design%20Pattern/Singleton%20Pattern) - A class of which only a single instance can exist
* [Builder Pattern](https://github.com/adichamoli/DesignPatterns/tree/main/Creational%20Design%20Pattern/Builder%20Pattern) - Separates object construction from its representation
* [Factory Pattern](https://github.com/adichamoli/DesignPatterns/tree/main/Creational%20Design%20Pattern/Factory%20Pattern) - Creates an instance of several derived classes
* [Abstract Factory Pattern](https://github.com/adichamoli/DesignPatterns/tree/main/Creational%20Design%20Pattern/Abstract%20Factory%20Pattern) - Creates an instance of several families of classes
* [Prototype Pattern](https://github.com/adichamoli/DesignPatterns/tree/main/Creational%20Design%20Pattern/Prototype%20Pattern) - A fully initialized instance to be copied or cloned

### Structural Design Pattern
* [Adapter Pattern](https://github.com/adichamoli/DesignPatterns/tree/main/Structural%20Design%20Pattern/Adapter%20Pattern) - Match interfaces of different classes
* [Bridge Pattern](https://github.com/adichamoli/DesignPatterns/tree/main/Structural%20Design%20Pattern/Bridge%20Pattern) - Separates an objectâ€™s interface from its implementation
* [Composite Pattern](https://github.com/adichamoli/DesignPatterns/tree/main/Structural%20Design%20Pattern/Composite%20Pattern) - A tree structure of simple and composite objects
* [Decorator Pattern](https://github.com/adichamoli/DesignPatterns/tree/main/Structural%20Design%20Pattern/Decorator%20Pattern) - Add responsibilities to objects dynamically
* [Facade Pattern](https://github.com/adichamoli/DesignPatterns/tree/main/Structural%20Design%20Pattern/Facade%20Pattern) - A single class that represents an entire subsystem
* [Flyweight Pattern](https://github.com/adichamoli/DesignPatterns/tree/main/Structural%20Design%20Pattern/Flyweight%20Pattern) - A fine-grained instance used for efficient sharing
* [Proxy Pattern](https://github.com/adichamoli/DesignPatterns/tree/main/Structural%20Design%20Pattern/Proxy%20Pattern) - An object representing another object

### Behavioral Design Pattern
* [Chain of Responsibility](https://github.com/adichamoli/DesignPatterns/tree/main/Behavioral%20Design%20Pattern/Chain%20of%20Responsibility%20Pattern) - A way of passing a request between a chain of objects
* [Command	Pattern](https://github.com/adichamoli/DesignPatterns/tree/main/Behavioral%20Design%20Pattern/Command%20Pattern) - Encapsulate a command request as an object
* [Interpreter Pattern](https://github.com/adichamoli/DesignPatterns/tree/main/Behavioral%20Design%20Pattern/Interpreter%20Pattern) -	A way to include language elements in a program
* [Iterator	Pattern](https://github.com/adichamoli/DesignPatterns/tree/main/Behavioral%20Design%20Pattern/Iterator%20Pattern) -Sequentially access the elements of a collection
* [Mediator Pattern](https://github.com/adichamoli/DesignPatterns/tree/main/Behavioral%20Design%20Pattern/Mediator%20Pattern) -	Defines simplified communication between classes
* [Memento Pattern](https://github.com/adichamoli/DesignPatterns/tree/main/Behavioral%20Design%20Pattern/Memento%20Pattern) -	Capture and restore an object's internal state
* [Observer Pattern](https://github.com/adichamoli/DesignPatterns/tree/main/Behavioral%20Design%20Pattern/Observer%20Pattern) -	A way of notifying change to a number of classes
* [State	Pattern](https://github.com/adichamoli/DesignPatterns/tree/main/Behavioral%20Design%20Pattern/State%20Pattern) - Alter an object's behavior when its state changes
* [Strategy Pattern](https://github.com/adichamoli/DesignPatterns/tree/main/Behavioral%20Design%20Pattern/Strategy%20Pattern) - Encapsulates an algorithm inside a class
* [Template Method	Pattern](https://github.com/adichamoli/DesignPatterns/tree/main/Behavioral%20Design%20Pattern/Template%20Method%20Pattern) - Defer the exact steps of an algorithm to a subclass
* [Visitor Pattern](https://github.com/adichamoli/DesignPatterns/tree/main/Behavioral%20Design%20Pattern/Visitor%20Pattern) -	Defines a new operation to a class without change
