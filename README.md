# DesignPatterns

Design patterns are solutions to software design problems you find again and again in real-world application development. Patterns are about reusable designs and interactions of objects.

The 23 Gang of Four (GoF) patterns are generally considered the foundation for all other patterns. They are categorized in three groups: Creational, Structural, and Behavioral (for a complete list see below). This reference provides source code for each of the 23 GoF patterns.

# What are Design Patterns in software development?
 
Design Patterns in the object-oriented world is a reusable solution to common software design problems that occur repeatedly in real-world application development. It is a template or description of how to solve problems that can be used in many situations.

#### *"A pattern is a recurring solution to a problem in a context."*
 
#### *"Each pattern describes a problem that occurs over and over again in our environment, and then describes the core of the solution to that problem, in such a way that you can use this solution a million times over, without ever doing it the same way twice." - Christopher Alexander, A Pattern Language.*

Patterns are used by developers for their specific designs to solve their problems. Pattern choice and usage among various design patterns depends on individual needs and problems. Design patterns are a very powerful tool for software developers. It is important to understand design patterns rather than memorizing their classes, methods, and properties. It is also important to learn how to apply patterns to specific problems to get the desired result. This will be the required continuous practice for using and applying design patterns in day to day software development. First, identify the software design problem then see how to address these problems using design patterns and determine the best-suited design problem to solve the problem.
