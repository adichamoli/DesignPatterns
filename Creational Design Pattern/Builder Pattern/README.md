# Builder Design Pattern

Builder design pattern falls under the category of "Creational" design patterns. This pattern is used to build a complex object by using a step by step approach.

GOF (Gang of Four) says:

#### *"Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations"*

So, it is used to construct a complex object step by step and the final step returns the object. Also, the process of constructing an object should be generic so that it can be used to create different representations of the same object.

# Advantages of Builder Pattern

* The parameters to the constructor are reduced and are provided in highly readable method calls.
* Builder design pattern also helps in minimizing the number of parameters in constructor and thus there is no need to pass in null for optional parameters to the constructor.
* Object is always instantiated in a complete state
* Immutable objects can be build without much complex logic in object building process.

# Disadvantages of Builder Pattern

* The number of lines of code increase at least to double in builder pattern, but the effort pays off in terms of design flexibility and much more readable code.
* Requires creating a separate ConcreteBuilder for each different type of Product.

#### Builder
This is an interface which is used to define all the steps required to create a product.

#### ConcreteBuilder
This is a class which implements the Builder interface to create a complex product.

#### Product
This is a class which defines the parts of the complex object which are to be generated by the Builder Pattern.

#### Director
This is a class that is used to construct an object using the Builder interface.
